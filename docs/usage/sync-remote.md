# Sync to Remote Server

Sync autograded results to a remote server (e.g. a shared formgrader instance) via rsync + SSH:

```bash
mograder sync autograded/hw1/ --remote sciml --course-dir /home/svc_user/courses/es98e
```

This rsyncs `.py` and `.html` files to the remote `autograded/` directory, then runs `Gradebook.import_from_py()` on the server via SSH to update the remote gradebook. If the remote uses a uv-managed venv, pass `--venv-dir`:

```bash
mograder sync autograded/hw1/ --remote sciml --course-dir /home/svc_user/courses/es98e --venv-dir '~/marimo-server'
```

All three flags can be set in `mograder.toml` (see [Configuration](../configuration.md)) so you can just run `mograder sync autograded/hw1/`.

Autograded results can also be uploaded via the formgrader UI using the upload button in the Graded column of the Assignments table.
